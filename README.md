<# Hi there, I'm Solomon Amaning Odum👋

I'm a passionate **Data Scientist** who loves turning data into actionable insights. I specialize in **machine learning**, **data analysis**, **large language modeling**, and **predictive modeling**. Whether it's cleaning messy datasets or deploying scalable models, I thrive on solving real-world problems with data. I have over the past years worked on healthcare related AI use cases

Welcome to my GitHub! Here you’ll find a collection of my projects, research, and learning journey in the world of data science. 🚀

## 📌 Featured Projects
Here are some of the data science projects that I'm most proud of:

- **[USD/GBP Exchange Rate Forecast Application](https://github.com/SolomonAmaning/Forex-exchange-forecast)**  
  This application forecasts the USD/GBP exchange rate for up to 10 years. Users can input a custom USD and GBP rate, and the forecast will start from today’s date with the user-defined rate.
  The application provides interactive visualization features, allowing users to view historical exchange rates, explore forecasted trends, and highlight specific years for detailed rate information.
